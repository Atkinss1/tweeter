# Tweeter Clone with Personal Style
Hello there! This is my take on a Tweeter clone, a simple Twitter-like project. I've added a personal touch with some custom CSS styling to make it stand out.

## What's Inside
* Basic Tweeter Features: It mimics the core functionality of Twitter on a single page.
* My Styling Twist: I've spiced things up with my own CSS styles, giving it a unique look.

## How to Use
1. Get the Code: Fork and clone this template to your local machine.

2. Install Dependencies: Run npm install to grab the needed bits.

3. Fire It Up: Start the web server with npm run local. Your Tweeter clone will be live at http://localhost:8080/.

4. Explore: Open your browser, go to http://localhost:8080/, and see what I've put together.

## Make It Yours
Feel free to play around with the CSS files. Add your flair and see how it transforms the look and feel.

## Dependencies
Make sure you have these dependencies installed:

* body-parser: Helps with parsing incoming request bodies.
* chance: Adds a touch of randomness for various purposes.
* express: Takes care of server-side logic.
* md5: Ensures secure data handling with MD5 hash values.

These bits and bobs are essential for the Tweeter clone to work smoothly. Have fun exploring my little project!
